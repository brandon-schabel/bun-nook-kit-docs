## Quickstart
  
```bash
bash <(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/brandon-schabel/bun-nook-kit/main/scripts/quickstart.sh)
```
After you run the quickstart script it'll prompt you with the code to add to your zshrc/bashrc, this CLI script will point to the latest version of bnkit when using the CLI

## [Optional - CLI Install Instructions](bnk-cli/bnk-cli-readme.md)

## Key Features

- **Zero Third-Party Dependencies**: BNK relies solely on [Bun](https://bun.sh), ensuring lightweight and efficient operation.
- **Strong TypeScript Type Inferencing**: Enhances code reliability and eases development with powerful type support.
- **Modular Design**: Provides flexibility to use only what you need for your project.
- **Web API Standards**: Ensures broad compatibility and future-proofing.

## Stop Analysis Paralysis and Start Building
The goal of BNK is to provide a set of tools in which a developer can rapidly develop full-stack interactive JavaScript application with no additional dependencies, BNK relies on nothing but the APIs provided by Bun. Bun is now on >1.0 and is stable and as such BNK is focusing on providing a stable 1.0 release to lock in the APIs.


### Use What You need
#### Build a full stack server with templating:
Example of how you use the following modules to build out a full stack server
- [Server Module](readmes/server.md)   handle the application business logic - generate webpages on the server with...
- [HTMLody Module](readmes/htmlody.md) HTML templating with JSON object syntax. With a Tailwind-like CSS utility library!
- [SQLite Module](readmes/sqlite.md) store permanent data!
- [Auth Module](readmes/auth.md) - If your application requires it!

## Screenshots

An HTMLody component, as well the TypeScript inference abilities as all the types shown in the in intellisense were inferred from the SQLite schema configured for the user subscription.

The next two screenshots show how easy it can be to create and start a server - even with middleware with great type inference.

- **Web API Standards**: Ensures broad compatibility and future-proofing.

## Stop Analysis Paralysis and Start Building
The goal of BNK is to provide a set of tools in which a developer could rapidly build a highly fullstack interactive JavaScript application with no additional dependencies, BNK relies on nothing but the APIs provided by Bun. Bun is now on >1.0 and is stable and as such BNK is focusing on providing a stable 1.0 release to lock in the APIs.

# Modules
Modules are the core building blocks of Bun Nook Kit, each module was designed to be operate independently. So plug any module into any project that can run Bun or start building your next stack with multiple modules to build your own stack. Of course the [CLI](bnk-cli/bnk-cli-readme) is the quickest way to get started with a BNK project.

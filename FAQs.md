# Bun Nook Kit - Frequently Asked Questions

## What is the fastest way to get started with BNK?
```bash
bash <(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/brandon-schabel/bun-nook-kit/main/scripts/quickstart.sh)
```
(just make sure you're a folder where you'd like a project to be created)
## Does BNK offer a CLI?
Yes, read about the [CLI here](bnk-cli/bnk-cli-readme)
## What is Bun Nook Kit (BNK)?
Bun Nook Kit (BNK) is a robust development toolkit designed for the Bun JavaScript runtime, utilizing TypeScript. It's crafted to offer a modular, type-safe, and efficient approach for building applications, with a strong emphasis on zero third-party dependencies and adherence to Web API standards.

## How Does BNK Work?
BNK works by providing a collection of modules that developers can use to build web applications. These modules cover a range of functionalities, from server setup and HTML templating to SQLite integration and state management. Each module is designed to work independently or in conjunction with others, offering flexibility and customization for your project.

## Is BNK a Framework?
While BNK offers many features typical of a framework, it is more accurately described as a toolkit. Unlike a traditional framework that dictates application structure, BNK provides a set of tools and modules that developers can choose to integrate as needed, offering more flexibility and control over the development process.

## Can I Build an Entire Application with Just BNK?
Yes, BNK is equipped to handle the development of a full-stack application, provided the application does not require very complex features like payment processing. But if you do there is a stack for that called BNK's range of modules allows for the creation of everything from the server backend to frontend interfaces.

## Can BNK Plug into Existing Projects?
If it supports Bun(which a lot of Node projects are Bun-compatible), then yes! Since BNK is designed entirely and only on top of Bun, wherever you can use bun you can use BNK. You can seamlessly integrate any of BNK's modules into your current Bun-based project, enhancing its capabilities without the need to overhaul your existing codebase.

## Rapid Development with BNK
BNK's goal is to expedite the development process. With its modular design, developers can quickly scaffold projects, build libraries, or create plugins on top of BNK. Its flexibility allows for starting from nearly scratch and configuring projects precisely as desired.
